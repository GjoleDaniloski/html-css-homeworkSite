        <p>The main town beach „Lolić“ has been awarded a Blue flag for many years which confirms that the beach satisfies the criteria for sea quality and cleanness of the coast as well as the equipment on the beach. It is a pebble beach on the southwest part of the town. The most interesting part of the beach is the middle part. It is sunny and sandy with shallow waters so it is ideal for children. For those who like to hide away from the sun there is plenty of shade under the pine trees.

Bars, restaurants, backeries, stands with pancakes and fritters, beach gadgets and souvenirs, fast food and shops will offer a possibility to spend the day on the beach.

        <p><b> Near the town center of Betina there is a pebble-rocky, town beach Bilava.</b></p>
        <p>Near the town center of Betina there is a pebble-rocky, town beach Bilava. This beach is bathed in sun almost all day with only occasional tree that provides shade, and with it there is a view on Betina whose panorama is dominated by the baroque tower of the church of St. Francis of Assisi. The big advantage is parking next to the beach and close to restaurants and a children's playground which is why the beach is suitable for parents with children. Although there is near some trees provided shade, we recommend that you take an umbrella or a different type of protection from the sun if you are planning on a beach to spend most of the time.</p>
